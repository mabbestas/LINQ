# What is LINQ?
Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is a powerful set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language. LINQ Queries are the first-class language construct in C# .NET, just like classes, methods, events. The LINQ provides a consistent query experience to query objects (LINQ to Objects), relational databases (LINQ to SQL), and XML (LINQ to XML).

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is uniform query syntax in C# and VB.NET to retrieve data from different sources and formats. It is integrated in C# or VB, thereby eliminating the mismatch between programming languages and databases, as well as providing a single querying interface for different types of data sources.

For example, SQL is a Structured Query Language used to save and retrieve data from a database. In the same way, LINQ is a structured query syntax built in C# and VB.NET to retrieve data from different types of data sources such as collections, ADO.Net DataSet, XML Docs, web service and MS SQL Server and other databases.
