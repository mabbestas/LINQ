# What is LINQ?
Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is a powerful set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language. LINQ Queries are the first-class language construct in C# .NET, just like classes, methods, events. The LINQ provides a consistent query experience to query objects (LINQ to Objects), relational databases (LINQ to SQL), and XML (LINQ to XML).

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is uniform query syntax in C# and VB.NET to retrieve data from different sources and formats. It is integrated in C# or VB, thereby eliminating the mismatch between programming languages and databases, as well as providing a single querying interface for different types of data sources.

For example, SQL is a Structured Query Language used to save and retrieve data from a database. In the same way, LINQ is a structured query syntax built in C# and VB.NET to retrieve data from different types of data sources such as collections, ADO.Net DataSet, XML Docs, web service and MS SQL Server and other databases.


## LINQ Objects

We have different LINQ objects in VD.NET and C#; they are:

## LINQ Advantages

- We do not have to master the latest query language syntaxes for many data sources as it offers the standard query syntax for many data sources.
- In LINQ, we need to write less code than the conventional methodology. Through LINQ, we can reduce the code.
- LINQ offers compile-time error checking and intelligence support in Visual Studio. This feature allows us to evade run-time errors.
- LINQ offers various in-built methods that we can use to carry out different operations like ordering, filtering, grouping, etc.
- We can reuse the LINQ queries.

## Disadvantages of LINQ

- Through LINQ, it is difficult to write complex queries like SQL.
- It was developed in the code, and we cannot use the cache execution plan, which is the feature of SQL like we do in the stored procedures.
- If the query is not written correctly, then performance can be degraded.
- If we make some modifications to the queries, then we have to recompile the application and redeploy the dll file to the server.

## Importance of LINQ

LINQ is easy, high-level, and more ordered than SQL. When we have to use the Querying database, in all cases, LINQ is a more effective query language than SQL. We also have the advantages of the Intellisense as the LINQ query is developed behind the code. 

LINQ also includes full type checking at the compilation time to find the error in the compilation time itself. In VB.NET or C# for writing the query in LINQ is more straightforward. LINQ offers a “Unified Programming Model.” It enables us to work with many data sources through a standard or unified coding style. Therefore, we don’t need to learn different syntaxes to the query for several data sources.
